# lib-watch
A place where i can store interesting libs by category.

 *work in progress*


## ClojureScript
#### [Secretary](https://github.com/gf3/secretary "cljs routes lib") 
When I was messing around with reagent I found this lib inside the re-frame framework. 


## Clojure
#### [Luminus](http://www.luminusweb.net/ "clj web framework")
This is a web app framework I played around with a while ago.

### Questions
1. Can I use re-frame as the front end part of luminus?
